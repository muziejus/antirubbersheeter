/* This file can hold the object mapData, which can be the JSON contents
 * you copied when geocoding. Simply paste everything in below these lines
 * and, where the JSON begins with a “{”, add:
 *
 * var mapData = 
 *
 * to the beginning, so that the first line reads:
 *
 * var mapData = {
 *
 * Then, for the last line, add a semicolon at the very end, so the last
 * line looks like:
 *
 * };
 *
 * And that's it. PASTE BELOW THIS LINE. */
